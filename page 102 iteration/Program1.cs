            ////1. Create a one-dimensional Array of strings. Ask the user to input some text. Create a loop that goes through each string in the Array, adding the user’s text to the string. Then create a loop that prints off each string in the Array on a separate line.

            //3. Fix the infinite loop so it will execute.

            //4. Create a loop where the comparison used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a “<” operator.

            //5. Create a loop where the comparison used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a “<=” operator.

            //6. Create a List of strings where each item in the list is unique. Ask the user to select text to search for in the List. Create a loop that iterates through the loop and then displays the index of the array that contains matching text on the screen.

            //7. Add code to that above loop that tells a user if they put in text that isn’t in the List.

            //8. Add code to that above loop that stops it from executing once a match has been found.

            //9. Create a List of strings that has at least two identical strings in the List. Ask the user to select text to search for in the List. Create a loop that iterates through the loop and then displays the indices of the array that contain matching text on the screen.

            //10. Add code to that above loop that tells a user if they put in text that isn’t in the List.

            //11. Create a List of strings that has at least two identical strings in the List. Create a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list, a
